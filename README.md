Implementing linear models using california house pricing dataset.

This dataset has features such as MedInc, houseAge, AveRooms, AveBedrms, population, AveOccup, Latitude, Longitude, MedHouseVal which make 9 columns, and has 20640 number of rows.

This dataset is loaded using sklearn.datasets.

We dont have any null values and all the columns are of float datatype.

From the correlation matrix we observe that:

The target variable has strong correlation with the following features:

MedInc (0.69): Median income has a strong positive correlation with median house value.
AveRooms (0.15): Average number of rooms has a weak positive correlation with median house value.
HouseAge (0.11): House age has a very weak positive correlation with median house value.

This a simple assignment on further analysis and the detailed implementation of simple, multiple and locally weighted linear regression.
